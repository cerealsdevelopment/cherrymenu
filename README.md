Linux Additions for Cherry Trail Devices

I developed this simple python scripts because Cherry Trail devices always do not work Out of the Box.

The first one named Cherry Additions contains several functions

Prerequisites:

Python3

How to:

To run the script simply save it wherever you want.

Open terminal/Konsole and run:

python cherryadditions.py 

You will be presented with a menu with different options:

- Set Brightness
- Update the system without upgrading kernel
- Reboot, shutdown
- If you press 9 you terminate the script
