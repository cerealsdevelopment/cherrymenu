# cherrymenu
Linux Additions for Cherry Trail Devices

I developed this simple python scripts because Cherry Trail devices always do not work Out of the Box.

- Prerequisites:

  Python3

- How to:

  1. To run the script simply save it wherever you want.

  2. Open terminal/Konsole and run:

  3. python cherryadditions.py 

  You will be presented with a menu with different options:

  - Set Brightness
  - Update the system without upgrading kernel (ie Kernel 5.6.6 brought more frequent freezes and reboots than previous kernels. Until 5.7 is released the 5.3.7 works well, the worst issue encountered so far is the random inability to power on after a suspend)
  - Reboot, shutdown
  - If you press 9, you terminate the script
